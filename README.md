Summary :
This Dataset is obtained from BTS website which contain the information about flight delays. The dataset I used in 2016-2019.
Dataset can be found on https://www.transtats.bts.gov/OT_Delay/OT_DelayCause1.asp

I have created the visualizations in Tableau that answer the following questions: 
1. What are the percentage of different type of flight delay and how they are distributed over Carrier,Airport,Year,Month

2. Percentage of Cancelled/Diverted flight over Airport,Carrier,Month.

3. What are the Carrier that cause most delay and how they are ditributed by Top 20 Airport by Total Delay.

4. Which Airport cause most delay and type of delay that contribute most to that Airport.

5. Top 20 Airport that cause most delay and how they are distributed over Carrier.
